[Website Trust1Team][Trust1Team-url]

## External Dependencies

ReadMyCards makes use of the following external APIs:

##### CloudConvert
* to convert JPEG2000 images to JPEG
* to generate PDFs from HTML templates
##### ipinfo.io
* to retrieve geolocation and browser info of users

##### Marko.js
* Marko.js (v3.14.2) is used to generate and populate templates


###### This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.0.

## Requirements

* Node.js v6.9.2 LTS or higher
* Yarn v1.3.2 or higher


## Development server

Run yarn:
```ssh
$ yarn
```
Start the node.js process:
```ssh
$ node app.js
```
If you have nodemon installed you can also run
```ssh
$ nodemon app.js
```
a nodemon.json configuration is present that will only trigger a nodemon restart when server files are changed.

Now that the server is running, start the frontend:
```
$ npm start
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Deployment
Clone the repository in your desired directory and switch to the correct release tag.

##### Install dependencies with Yarn
```ssh
$ yarn
```

##### Run (production) build
```ssh
$ ng build (--prod)
```

If you do not have angular-cli installed on the server, you can use the local copy in `/node_modules/`:
```ssh
$ ./node_modules/.bin/ng build (--prod)
```

This the build task will generate a minfied/uglified/concatted distribution package in the /dist folder

Create a configuration YAML file called *config.yml* in the */config* directory. An example is provided. Make sure you change the environment to something other than *local*.

A full deployment guide can be found on [Confluence][rmc-confluence-deployment-guide]

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).


## Extract translation files

Run Angular's i18n extractor:
```bash
$ ng xi18n
```
This will extract all translatable string from templates. This file can then be used for further translations
