## Deployment
Clone the repository in your desired directory and switch to the correct release tag.

##### Install dependencies with Yarn
```ssh
$ yarn
```

##### Run (production) build
```ssh
$ ng build (--prod)
```

If you do not have angular-cli installed on the server, you can use the local copy in `/node_modules/`:
```ssh
$ ./node_modules/.bin/ng build (--prod)
```

This the build task will generate a minfied/uglified/concatted distribution package in the /dist folder

Create a configuration YAML file called *config.yml* in the */config* directory. An example is provided. Make sure you change the environment to something other than *local*.

###
create a postgres with the following schema
```ssh
-- Sequence
CREATE SEQUENCE IF NOT EXISTS "public"."validations_id_seq";

-- Table Definition
CREATE TABLE "public"."validations" (
    "id" int4 NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('validations_id_seq'::regclass),
    "phonenumber" varchar,
    "rndata" text,
    "otp" varchar,
    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
